# Nested-Named-Entity-Recognition-on-CMeEE-Dataset-with-Large-Pretrained-Models

This is the repository for our course project of AI3612 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. In this project, we employed and fine-tuned traditional NLP models like BERT and BART on the CMeEE dataset, in order to enhance performance in Chinese named entity recognition tasks. 

Additionally, we harnessed the GPT-3.5-turbo API, incorporating prompt techniques such as chain-of-thought, self-consistency and GPT-NER, along with post-processing methods, to efficiently accomplish the given task.
